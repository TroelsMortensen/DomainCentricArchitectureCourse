# Session 2 - Domain-Driven Design

### Topics
* Introduction to DDD
* Ubiquitous language
* Value Objects
* Entities
* Aggregates
* Rich Domain Model

## Preparation before class
We're going to do implementation with generics, make sure you have a decent understanding of this topic:
* [Gain a basic understanding of generics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/generics)

We might be using the yield keyword:
* [yield return](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/yield)

Optional: You may choose to use reflection in part of your implementation, so here's an overview:
* [Gain a basic understanding of reflection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/viewing-type-information) <- This should cover how to extract properties of a class. Needed for challenge-part of future assignment.

Optional: Use enumeration classes instead of enums. There are different ways to handle this:
* [Enumeration class](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2008/08/12/enumeration-classes/)
* [Other example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/enumeration-classes-over-enum-types)
