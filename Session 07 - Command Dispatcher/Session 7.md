# Session 7 - Command Dispatcher pattern

### Topics
* Command Dispatcher pattern
* Various implementation strategies
* Decorator pattern, and pipelines

## Preparation before class

We are going to use ASP.NET's DI Container, IServiceProvider, you may [look at this](https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/aspnet-core-dependency-injection-what-is-the-iserviceprovider-and-how-is-it-built). But we won't do anything fancy with it.

I will introduce the [Decorator pattern](https://www.bytehide.com/blog/decorator-pattern-csharp), though simpler.
