# Session 12

It will probably be a pretty short session.

I will introduce the exam questions. We talk about the exam format.

You work perhaps more on your assignments.

A survey of the course, so I can get some feedback. I hope you will all take the time to respond. As this is the first iteration of the course, your feedback is super valuable.
